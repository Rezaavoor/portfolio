A web app that gives suggestion on what to do in your city based on your interests. You swipe left and right on different events and the app learns what you like and dislike and gives you better suggestions over time. The app is built with a React frontend and an Express backend. The backend is hosted on Microsoft Azure and the database is hosted on Supabase. The app is currently in development and will be released in the near future.
